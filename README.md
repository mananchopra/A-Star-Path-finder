The application uses A Star algorithm to find the shortest path between source and destination. This project is made by using html 5/css/Java Script. The working of algorithm is 
displayed to show how the algorithm works. When it finds a path, the shortest path is displayed by a blue line indicating the path to travel. The project has a button which allows 
user to include or exclude the diagnol traversal. There are two more button start and reset. The start button when clicked starts finding shortest path. The reset button resets 
different kinds of mazes of obstacles between source and destination.
