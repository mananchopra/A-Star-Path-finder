The application uses A* algorithm to find the shortest path between source and destination. This project is made by using HTML 5/CSS/Java Script. The working of algorithm is displayed to show how the algorithm works. When it finds a path, the shortest path is displayed by a blue line indicating the path to travel. The project has a button which allows user to include or exclude the diagonal traversal. There are three more button run, step and reset. The run button when clicked starts finding shortest path. The reset button resets different kinds of mazes of obstacles between source and destination. The step button when clicked shows step by step traversal of A* algorithm.
